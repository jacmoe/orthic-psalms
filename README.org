The source is an adaption of the 1762 printing of the /Book of Psalms/ from 1662 by John Baskerville written Charles Wohlers of Satucket Software and made available at the following address: http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/1662/psalms.pdf

The only thing changed is that the medial and long /s/ has been replaced by modern s to aid in reading, plus formatting fit for electronic viewing.

This is meant to be used in conjunction with the Orthic Psalms reading books available here: https://orthic.shorthand.fun/psalms-pdfs and here: https://orthic.shorthand.fun/reporting-psalms
